## What we're working on

The project is still at an early stage, which means there are a lot of opportunities to contribute in a meaningful way. To ease the onboarding process,  issues will be gathered and created issues in the issue tracker. Please take a look at the [opened issues](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/local-sheriff/issues).


## How to submit changes

Once you've identified one of the issues above that you feel you can contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository!

1. **Notify others by commenting on the issue**. By commenting on the issue, you
   will initiate a discussion around possible solutions and also communicate to
   other contributors that you started working on it. This will avoid having
   several people starting working on the same thing.
2. **[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository**. This makes your own version of this project you can edit and use.
3. **[Make your changes](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes)**! You can do this in the GitHub interface on your own local machine (we *strongly recommend that you create a new branch* to make your changes). Once you're happy with your changes...
4. **Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.7/user/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)**. This opens a discussion around your project and lets the project lead know you are proposing changes.

## How to report bugs

Bugs are everywhere, and we would love it if you could be on the lookout for them, and raise an [issue](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/local-sheriff/issues) if you find one. Bugs can be anywhere:

* Conceptual design,
* Code,
* Spelling or formatting,
* or anything else we haven't yet thought of.

If you notice a bug, please raise an issue and label it with the label `bug`. Then anyone in community can get right on it, and everything gets fixed faster.
